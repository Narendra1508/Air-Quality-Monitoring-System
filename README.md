# Air-Quality-Monitoring-System
This project is part of the course "Data Acquisition Technologies and Sensor Networks"

The system discussed in this project measures temperature, humidity and dust density as the three main parameters for monitoring.

ESP32(micro-controller), dust sensor, temperature & humidity sensor are used to measure the above mentioned parameters.

The measured data is then transfered to the mysql server hosted on the apache web server and stored.

This data is used to create the graphs in the dashboard which is created using Dash.
